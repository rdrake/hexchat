# HexChat (GTK4 fork)

A work-in-progress fork of HexChat modernized around GTK4 with expanded IRCv3 support. **This is not release-ready** — expect bugs, rough edges, and the occasional crash. If you want a stable IRC client today, use [upstream HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/).

Upstream HexChat [documentation](https://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) still applies for most basics ([FAQ](https://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/faq.html), [Python API](https://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/script_python.html), [Perl API](https://hexchat.readthedocs.org/en/latest/script_perl.html)).

## What's new in this fork

- **GTK4 port** (replacing the GTK+ frontend), with an overhauled xtext renderer (mark-based scroll anchoring, display-line cache), unified main-GUI margins, magnetic pane detents, and progressive column/tree collapse when space is tight.
- **Tray icon** rewritten on top of [LizardByte/tray](https://github.com/LizardByte/tray), replacing the old bespoke tray code. Currently wired up on Windows only; the library itself is cross-platform, so Linux/macOS backends can be enabled without swapping out the integration.
- **SQLite-backed scrollback** with a zstd-compressed VFS, replacing the old flat text-file scrollback. Also stores reaction and reply metadata alongside messages for IRCv3 draft features.
- **IRCv3 3.1/3.2 core:** multi-prefix, away-notify, account-notify, extended-join, server-time, userhost-in-names, cap-notify, chghost, setname, invite-notify, account-tag.
- **IRCv3 message framework:** `message-tags`, `batch`, `echo-message`, `labeled-response`.
- **SASL:** PLAIN, EXTERNAL, SCRAM-SHA-1/256/512, OAUTHBEARER.
- **IRCv3 drafts** (wired up, some with caveats — see below): `chathistory`, `multiline`, `event-playback`, `read-marker`, `message-redaction`, `metadata-2`, `channel-rename`, `pre-away`, `account-registration`, `extended-isupport`.

## Known rough edges

- Persistence features (`chathistory` / `read-marker` / `metadata-2`) don't yet surface auth-required failures gracefully — on servers that require login for history, requests just silently fail.
- Intermittent crashes: opening the quit dialog; closing the find bar.
- Pane collapse can clip on fast drags.
- Chanview tree dotted-line indentation is currently broken.
- Display lists in compact mode/Chanview smaller text is incomplete.
- macOS integration is designed but not yet implemented.

## Building

### Windows (Visual Studio)
Open `win32/hexchat.sln` in Visual Studio 2022. Build dependencies come from [gvsbuild](https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild) built for GTK4, plus a separately installed OpenSSL. Optional: libwebsockets, jansson, libcurl for OAuth2.

`win32/hexchat.props` contains environment-specific paths and is not committed.

### Linux (Meson)
```bash
meson setup builddir
meson compile -C builddir
```

Debian-family dependencies:
```
sudo apt install build-essential meson ninja-build gettext libgtk-4-dev libssl-dev \
  libdbus-glib-1-dev libcanberra-dev libnotify-dev liblua5.4-dev libpython3-dev \
  libperl-dev libx11-dev python3-cffi libluajit-5.1-dev libpci-dev python3-dev \
  desktop-file-utils libsqlite3-dev libjansson-dev libsoup-3.0-dev libwebsockets-dev \
  libsecret-1-dev
```
